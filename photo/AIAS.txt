1.  Kindly discuss the different layers of the OSI Model.

//The Open System Interconnections(OSI) Model is divided into 7 models: 
Physical Layer
- this includes the transmission of a digital data into a bit stream, with this transmission the bit rate is measured as bits per second (bps)
Data Link Layer
- provides a reliable communication link between connected devices and a physical medium, it is responsible for retransmission of data, and flow control (maintaining a balance transmission between speed and ability to process the incoming data). 
Network Layer
- this layer is responsible for sending/routing data between devices across different networks. Also, it translates a logical network address into a physical address to manage issues such as traffic control to ease the data transmission over a network
Transport Layer
- it ensures that the message will be delivered error-free 
Session Layer
- Handles Data Synchronization (in terms of multiple data exhange, it is important to synchronize data to ensure the accuracy in communication
Presentation Layer
- translates data from the application layer into a format that the application layer can read and understand
Application Layer
- highest layer in the OSI Model
  
2.  Differentiate the following Local Area Network Technologies:
Ethernet
- allows devices to transmit data with the use of cables
Token Ring
- ring topology
- operates at a various speed including 4 and 16 Mbps. 
FDDI
- dual ring topology
- its suits for critical applications (backbone network)

3.  Differentiate the following Wide Area Network Technologies:
Point-to-Point Protocol
- excels in providing reliable and secure connectivity for home users
X.25
- active in connecting remote terminals to central mainframes, enabling access to centralized computing resources and data.
Frame Relay
- less expensive option to leased lines, this inexpensive method connects distant offices inside a corporate network environment.
Asynchronous Transfer Mode
- supports various forms of traffic, such as voice, data, and video, by assigning Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to each cell. Initially envisioned as a comprehensive solution for both LAN and WAN communication.
